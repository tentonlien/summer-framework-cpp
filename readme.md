## About This Project

As we know, Spring framework with its eco-system plays an important role in Java Web Development. I love both the excellent performance of C++ programs and the well-designed architecture of Spring framework. Therefore, I decided to build a new C++ framework modelling after Spring and other popular Java web components.

The framework is written in C++11 and built with GCC-C++ compiler on Linux. Web Applications based on this framework can run on Linux server. As reinvention is needless, the design and implementation of the framework complies with the standard from Spring technology system as much as possible, especially what Spring Boot has always prioritised - *Convention over configuration*; and reimplements some Java web dev tools with C++ and integrates some good solutions. Therefore, you can make full use of hardware's performance at a low learning curve with this solution.
